Vanila WSL2 Ubuntu install

Install different shells to maximise your producitivty. I am going to setup, and use zsh. Then update it with oh-my-zsh and Powerlevel10K

There are other shells that can be installed as well like Starship - https://github.com/starship/starship. For now let's stick with zsh

Please see the script to setup all the neccessary installation to your environment
