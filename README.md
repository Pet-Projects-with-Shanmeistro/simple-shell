## üöÄ Benefits of Using This Setup

- **Consistency:** Ensure a uniform development environment across different machines.
- **Time-Saving:** Automate the installation of essential tools and configurations, saving you valuable setup time.
- **Easy Customization:** Tailor your environment by simply editing a configuration file to include the tools you need.
- **Modularity:** The setup is organized into logical roles, making it easy to understand and extend.
- **Flexibility:** Supports both Bash and Zsh shells with options for popular prompt frameworks like Starship and Powerlevel10k.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Ansible:** Version 2.9 or higher (used for the automation).
- **Git:** For cloning this repository.
- **Curl:** For downloading necessary scripts and files.
- **sudo Privileges:** Administrative rights are required for installing packages.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these simple steps to set up your awesome development environment:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd my-awesome-shell-setup
```

*(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual URL of your repository.)*

### 2. Make the Installation Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x install_custom_shell.sh
```

### 3. Run the Installation Script

```bash
./install_custom_shell.sh
```

This script will:

- Check for the necessary prerequisites.
- Prompt you to choose your preferred shell (Bash or Zsh).
- If you choose Zsh, it will ask for your preferred prompt framework (Oh My Zsh + Powerlevel10k or Starship).
- Ask for confirmation before proceeding with the installation.
- Run the Ansible playbook to configure your environment.

### 4. Customize Your Setup

Before or after running the script, you can customize the tools to be installed by editing the `ansible/group_vars/all.yml` file. This file contains flags (e.g., `install_docker: false`) that you can set to `true` to include the corresponding tool in your setup.

### 5. Apply Changes

After the script completes, **restart your terminal** or run:

- `source ~/.bashrc` (for Bash)
- `exec zsh` (for Zsh)

---

## üíª Usage

Once the installation is complete, you'll have a personalized development environment ready to go! Here are some tips:

- **Explore Your New Shell:** Enjoy the enhanced features and prompt of your chosen shell (Bash with Starship or Zsh with Starship/Powerlevel10k).
- **Customize Further:**
  - **Starship:** Configure your Starship prompt by editing the `~/.config/starship.toml` file.
  - **Powerlevel10k:** If you chose Zsh with Powerlevel10k, you can further customize it by running `p10k configure` in your terminal.
- **Utilize Installed Tools:** The `sysadmin-tools` and `dev-tools` roles install a variety of useful utilities that are now at your fingertips.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Running the Playbook Directly (Advanced)

For more fine-grained control, you can run the Ansible playbook directly:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/localhost ansible/custom_dev_env.yml -K --tags <role_tag>
```

- `-K`: Prompts for the sudo password.
- `--tags <role_tag>`: Allows you to run specific roles (e.g., shell, sysadmin-tools, dev-tools).

---

## üìÇ Roles Overview

This setup is organized into the following Ansible roles:

- **`common`:** Contains tasks that are common to all environments, such as basic system configurations.
- **`shell`:** Configures your chosen shell (Bash or Zsh) and sets up the prompt.
- **`sysadmin-tools`:** Installs essential system administration and networking utilities (e.g., htop, tmux, nmap).
- **`dev-tools`:** Installs development-related tools, including Python, uv, ruff, taplo, Node.js (nvm), and more.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Managing Installed Tools

You can easily add or remove tools after the initial setup:

1. **Edit `ansible/group_vars/all.yml`:** Modify the `install_*` flags in the Sysadmin Tools Role and Dev Tools Role sections. Set the flag to `true` to install a tool or `false` to prevent its installation (or removal on a subsequent run).

2. **Run the Ansible Playbook:**

   ```bash
   ./install_custom_shell.sh
   ```

   Or, to target specific tool roles:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i ansible/inventory/localhost ansible/custom_dev_env.yml -K --tags sysadmin-tools,dev-tools
   ```

Ansible will update your system based on the changes in `group_vars/all.yml`.

‚ö†Ô∏è Removing Packages and Libraries:

This script primarily installs tools using your system's package manager or via tools like pip and cargo. To completely remove a tool and its dependencies, you should use the appropriate uninstallation command for the package manager that installed it (e.g., `sudo apt remove <package>`, `brew uninstall <package>`, `pip uninstall <package>`, `cargo uninstall <package>`). Manual removal is recommended to avoid unintended consequences.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customization

Beyond the basic `group_vars/all.yml` configuration, you can further customize your environment by:

- **Modifying Role Tasks:** Edit the task files within the `ansible/roles/` directories to change installation procedures or add new tools.
- **Creating New Roles:** Organize more complex customizations into new roles and include them in the `ansible/custom_dev_env.yml` playbook.
- **Templating Configuration Files:** The `ansible/templates/` directory contains Jinja2 templates for shell configuration files. You can modify these templates to fine-tune your shell environment.
